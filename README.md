# Chatbot for Meal Picture Queries
## Project Description
This project involves developing a python program to automatically respond to patient queries about meal pictures sent via WhatsApp. Curelink provides comprehensive care to patients with conditions such as PCOS, preconception, and pregnancy through various communication mediums. This program aims to replace manual review processes with AI-driven responses to streamline care delivery.

The core functionality of the project is to generate accurate and context-aware responses to meal pictures submitted by patients. The system uses Large Language Model i.e. **gemini-1.5-flash** to analyze the meal images, compare them against the prescribed diet charts, and generate actionable advice based on the patientâ€™s medical profile and chat history.
